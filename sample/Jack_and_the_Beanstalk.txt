Jack and the Beanstalk

Once upon a very long time ago,
a very poor boy named Jack
went off to sell a cow, just as his mother told him.
On the way, he met a mysterious man.

“Give me that cow, and I’ll give you this magic bean!” the man said.

“Magic?” said Jack.
Jack excitedly traded the cow for the bean.

His mother was furious,
and threw the bean out the window.

The next morning, there was a gigantic beanstalk growing outside!
“The top is somewhere way up there in the clouds!” said Jack.

Jack was overjoyed, and started climbing it.
Before long, he saw a castle.

A woman came out from it.

“This is a giant’s house. Hurry up and escape!” she said.
“What?!” said Jack.
Just as Jack was about to leave…

Stomp!
Stomp!
The footsteps were coming closer and closer.

“Oh dear, you’re going to get eaten! Go hide in the stove,” said the woman.

Just when Jack was hiding himself,
a hairy-old giant appeared.

Sniff. Sniff.
“I smell the smell of a little boy,” said the giant.
“You must be imagining things,” said the woman.

So the giant scarfed down a baby cow instead,
then dozed off while counting his gold coins.
“Now’s the time!” said Jack.

Jack threw a sackful of gold coins over his shoulder, and raced out of the castle.
He was in such a rush, however, that he ended up falling down.

The giant woke up.
“Wait!” roared the giant.

Jack climbed down the beanstalk as fast as he could,
but the giant was quickly getting closer and closer.
"Mom, quick - bring the axe!” yelled Jack.

Once Jack got the axe, he swung with all his might.
Creak, creak, boom!

The beanstalk came crashing down, with the giant falling to his death.

From then on, Jack stuck to an honest day’s work,
and lived happily ever after with his mother.
